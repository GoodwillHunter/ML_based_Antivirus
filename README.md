# ML_based_Antivirus
ML based antivirus trained automatically by Watson AutoAI

As I saw many people on github trying to train diffirent traditional ML models and deep learning models on the virus dataset, I set out to try the task using Watson AutoAI.

It trains diffirent models automatically and returns the accuracy.
I download the notebook and upload it here if ayone wants to replicate (watson not needed).

So far this is the accuracy - 
1. Random forest classifier (0.994)


Results of @llSourcell (https://github.com/llSourcell/antivirus_demo)
DecisionTree : 99.156103 %
RandomForest : 99.369794 %
GradientBoosting : 98.924303 %
AdaBoost : 98.779428 %
GNB : 70.199203 %
Winner algorithm is RandomForest with a 99.369794 % success

Results of @nikhilraghava (https://github.com/nikhilraghava/ML-Antivirus)
were suspiciously same as of @llSourcell :P

I'm very happy with the results as it is better than/comparable to most people got from their manual experimentation.
