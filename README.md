# ML_based_Antivirus
ML based antivirus trained automatically by Watson AutoAI

As I saw many people on github trying to train diffirent traditional ML models and deep learning models on the virus dataset, I set out to try the task using Watson AutoAI.

It trains diffirent models automatically and returns the accuracy.
I download the notebook and upload it here if ayone wants to replicate (watson not needed).

So far this is the accuracy - 
1. Random forest classifier (0.994)


I'm very happy with the results as it is better than most people got from their manual experimentation.
